## How to install and change wallpaper on macOS

To change your desktop background, open `System Preferences` > `Desktop & Screen Saver`  or `System Settings` > `Wallpaper` on Ventura and select another wallpaper from the available ones.

You have several options to install new wallpapers:

1. The easiest one is to drop them directly in your Pictures folder by pressing `Shift-Command-G` to `Go to Folder` `~/Pictures` and dropping the wallpaper there.

2. A slightly more involved one is to create a Wallpapers folder anywhere on your system, drop your downloaded wallpapers there, and finally press the `+` button under `Desktop & Screen Saver` to add your newly created folder to `Folders`. Now choose your wallpaper from that Wallpapers folder.

3. A third way, and the one I recommend, is to add your dynamic HEIC wallpaper file directly to `/Library/Desktop Pictures`. Press `Shift-Command-G` to `Go to Folder` `/Library/Desktop Pictures`. Drop your HEIC wallpaper file there (you will be asked to enter your password). Open the `Desktop & Screen Saver` panel from `System Preferences`, then `Apple > Desktop Pictures`. You will find `DesertClouds` under the `Dynamic Desktop` group.
